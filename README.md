# Node.js Training Project

This repository contains the outcomes of a *three-day intensive Node.js training* conducted at TeamSystem Tirana. The course covered fundamental concepts of Node.js, REST API development, web security, and database integration. Though only half of the materials were saved, this repository represents the essential components of the training.

## Project Overview

This training aimed to equip participants with a working knowledge of *Node.js* by building REST APIs, securing endpoints, and connecting to a database. The course was a collaborative effort between teammates, focusing on practical implementations.

## Topics Covered
1. *Node.js Basics*  
   Introduction to the core concepts of Node.js, including modules, event-driven architecture, and asynchronous programming.
   
2. *REST API Development*  
   Creating a RESTful API using Node.js, with routes, controllers, and request/response handling.

3. *Web Security with JWT*  
   Implementation of *JWT (JSON Web Token)* for securing web applications, managing user authentication and authorization.

4. *Database Integration*  
   Connecting to a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for data storage and retrieval in a Node.js application.
